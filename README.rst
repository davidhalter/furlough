Furlough - a Furlough Tracker for NGOs
======================================

Developed originally for an NGO, this furlough tracker allows you to easily
overview your employees with their different capabilities. The problem for NGOs
is that they have furloughs every few years and that vacation resets at that
point (and starts fresh when the furlough is finished). This is much more
complicated than in a normal company.

This tools goal is mainly a good visual overview with an easy-to-use GUI.
